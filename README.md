  <h3><i>One night(blind man)</i> </h3>
  <div>
  <p> "As he was coming home after having a dinner outside, he came across a group of young travellers.<br>They saw that he was blind, yet carrying a lighted lamp. They started passing comments on him and made a fun of him."</p>
  <h4>One of the traveller asked him,</h4>
  <p> “Hey Man! You are blind and can’t see anything! Why do you carry the lamp then?!”</p>
